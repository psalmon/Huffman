Huffman
=======

An implementation of the Huffman encoding algorithm.

Supply a string from the command line and the algorithm will compress it, output it's encoded string, and then decompress it, outputting it's decompressed string.

Unimplemented corner case includes strings of sizes 0, 1, and 2.

Added a Gradle build file with JUnit test cases. You can add more test cases in src/test/Huffman.java in the runTests() function for example, you can just supply strings to tester(...)
