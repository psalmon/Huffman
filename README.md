Huffman
=======

An implementation of the Huffman encoding algorithm.

Supply a string from the command line and the algorithm will compress it, output it's encoded string, and then decompress it, outputting it's decompressed string.

You can use the test function with a supplied string from inside Huffman.java to perform a junit assert for equality of pre / post encoding.

Unimplemented corner case includes strings of sizes 0, 1, and 2.
